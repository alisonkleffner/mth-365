## R Studio Set-Up

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio.png")

```

To Create a Script, Click the Following: File -> New File -> R script

## Giant Calculator!

.pull-left[
```{r}
3+4 #Addition
5-2 #Subtraction
3*2 #Multiplication
9/3 #Division 
```
].pull-right[
```{r}
sqrt(4)
2^3
exp(3)
log(10)
```
]

Note: Adding a "#" to your R Script creates a comment so can take notes

## Giant Calculator!

.pull-left[
```{r}
log(10, base = 10)
abs(-1)
floor(3.7)
ceiling(3.2)
```
].pull-right[
```{r}
pi
sin(pi/2)
5%%3 #division remainder
```
]

---

## Giant Calculator!

```{r}
a <- 2
b <- 4
c <- 3
```


**Note**: In R, the following will not work!
```{r eval = FALSE}

b(a+c)
```
*R* will assume the "b()" is indicating some function, NOT multiplication as we do in math and stats. 

Thus, you MUST include the multiplication symbol.
```{r}
b*(a+c)
```

---

## Creating Variables

We can create variables using the assignment operator `<-`

```{r}
x <- 5
```

We can then perform any of the functions on the variables:

```{r}
log(x)
```

Rules of Naming Variables:
+ Variables can't start with a number
+ Case-sensitive
+ There are reserved words that *R* won't let you use for variables names
  - for, in, while, if, else, repeat, break, next

---
## Vectors

A variable does not need to be a single value. We can create a **vector** using the `c` function (combine- combines several objects into one)

```{r}
y <- c(1, 5, 3, 2)
```


Operations can then be done element-wise

```{r}
y/2
```

Determining number of objects in a vector

```{r}
length(y)
```

---
## Vectors

Can also have vectors of characters

```{r}
bulldogs <- c("american", "english", "french")
bulldogs
```


```{r}
length(bulldogs)
       
str(bulldogs)
```

---

## Logical Values

```{r}
a <- 4
a==5

a <= 5
a !=5
```

---

## Creating a Sequence

```{r}
seq(1, 8, by= 0.5)

seq(1, 8, length = 5)


```

---

## Getting Help

Let's talk about a couple ways to get help. The primary function to use is the `help` function. Just pass in the name of the function you need help with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
help(head)
```

The `?` also works
```{r eval = FALSE}
?head
```

This returns the help documentation for this function

Googling for help can be difficult at first. You might need to search for R + CRAN +  to get good results

Stackoverflow is VERY helpful!

[R Reference Card](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf)

---
## R Packages

- Commonly used *R* function are installed with base *R*
- *R* packages containing more specialized *R* functions can be installed freely from CRAN servers using the function `install.packages()`
  + Should now show up in *Packages* Tab
- After packages are installed, their function can be loaded into the current *R* session using the function `library()`


---

## Installing Packages

**Note**: To run code from your script:
+ Windows: Ctrl + Enter
+ Mac: Cmd + Enter
+ Highlight what you want to run and hit the “Run” button

We will be installing the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) package.
- Manipulates data structures (includes dplyr, tidyr, purr, tibble, etc packages)

**Method 1**
```{r, eval= FALSE}

install.packages("tidyverse")

```

**Method 2** - Point and Click

+ Tools -> Install Packages

Only have to do this once!!

---
## Load Package

Let's load the package we just installed!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Will have to run this every time we are in a new session and want to use this package

---

## Load Data

We usually work with .csv file in R. When you have a file that need to be read into the Rstudio, first save the data set to the same file folder as your R file, or set the working directory to the file. 

First Check your working directory!

Method 1:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
getwd() #What is your working directory
setwd() # Change Working directory

```

Method 2 (recommendation):

Session -> Set Working Directory -> Choose Directory -> Select folder data set is located -> Apply

---
## Load Data

Second, then load in the data
```{r, echo=FALSE}
data = read.csv("../../Week 1/data/dc-wikia-data.csv")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data = read.csv("dc-wikia-data.csv")
```

```{r, linewidth=80}
head(data, n = 3) #make sure data loads in correctly

```

Should see data in environment panel (upper right)
---

## Check Variable Types

```{r}
str(data)

```

<br>
Note: The purpose of checking variable types is to make sure R is understanding what each column is representing.

---

## Change Variable Types

*R* does not always read in the variables correctly. Let's pretend in this scenario, we wanted the `Year` variable to be a character. We can change this!

```{r}
#To change this column to a factor:
data$year <- as.character(data$year)


#Now Year is a character!
class(data$year)

```

[More about Data Types](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/r-data-types/)
---

## Selecting Specific Row/Column

```{r}
data[1,] #first row
data[,1] #first column 

```

---

## Selecting Specific Row/Column

```{r}
data[1:2,c(2,5,7)] #row: 1-2, column: 2,5,7
```

We can use `$` to specify columns as well

```{r}
head(data$page_id)
```


---

## Some Basic Functions

```{r}
summary(data[,8:11])

nrow(data)

ncol(data)
```

---
## Built-In Statistical Functions

```{r}
mean(data$APPEARANCES, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(data$APPEARANCES, na.rm = TRUE)
summary(data$APPEARANCES)
quantile(data$APPEARANCES, c(0.025, 0.975), na.rm = TRUE) #na.rm removes missing values
```

---

## Warnings vs. Errors

+ Routinely beginners to R panic if they see a red message as innocuous as confirming that a library loaded
  - Not all red text means that there is an error!

+ A *warning* is a message that does not disturb the program flow but is displayed along with the output

  - Not always a cause for concern

+ An *error* will terminate a program from being ran

+ Google is a beautiful thing
