## DSC365: Intro to Data Science
### Introduction to R
#### January 15, 2026

---
### Agenda

- R as a Calculator
- Basic Functions
- Installing Packages
- Loading Data

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

**Note**: Please follow along and run the code in the file *IntroR.R* found in BlueLine

---
### Writing Code for People

-  A **comment** is a part of computer code which is intended only for people to read. It is not evaluated or run by the computing language. 
  - In `R` we use `#`
```{r}
# This is a comment
```
-  **Literate Programming**: interspersing text and code in the same document
  - We will learn more about this next week.
  
---
#### Giant Calculator!

.pull-left[
```{r}
3+4 #Addition
5-2 #Subtraction
3*2 #Multiplication
9/3 #Division 
sqrt(4) #square root
2^3 #exponent
```
].pull-right[
```{r}
exp(3) #exponential function
log(10) #natural log
abs(-1) #absolute value
floor(3.7) #round down
ceiling(3.2) #round up
round(3.2) #typical rounding rules
```
]

---
### Giant Calculator!


**Note**: In R, the following will not work!
```{r eval = FALSE}
10(2+4)
```
*R* will assume the "10()" is indicating some function, NOT multiplication as we do in math and stats. 

Thus, you MUST include the multiplication symbol.
```{r}
10*(2+4)
```


Calculates using your Order of Operations, so be careful with `()`

---
### Creating Variables

A variable is like a container that hold something.

We can create variables using the assignment operator `<-`

```{r}
x <- 5 
```

Should now see `x` in the `Environment` Window

We can then perform any of the functions on the variables:

```{r}
log(x)
```

<br>

Shortcut to make arrow:

- Mac: `Option` + `-`
- PC: `Alt` + `-`

---
### Naming Variables ... It's hard


Rules of Naming Variables:
+ Variables can't start with a number
+ Can't use some special symbols (`^`, `!`, `$`, `@`, `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`)
+ Case-sensitive
+ There are reserved words that *R* won't let you use for variables names
  - for, in, while, if, else, repeat, break, next


<br>

My general tips:

- Avoid meaningless names
- Be consistent with conventions
- Don't make too long/difficult to spell

---
### Vectors

A variable does not need to be a single value. We can create a **vector** using the `c` function (combine- combines several objects into one)

```{r}
y <- c(1, 5, 3, 2)
```


Operations can then be done element-wise

```{r}
y/2
```

Determining number of objects in a vector

```{r}
length(y)
```

---
### Vectors

Can also have vectors of characters

```{r}
bulldogs <- c("american", "english", "french")
bulldogs
```


```{r}
length(bulldogs)
       
str(bulldogs)
```

---
### R Packages

- **Packages**: include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data.
  - List of all installed packages in **Packages** Tab
- *R* packages containing more specialized *R* functions can be installed freely from CRAN servers using the function `install.packages()`
- After packages are installed, their function can be loaded into the current *R* session using the function `library()`

---
### Step 1: Installing Packages


We will be installing the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) package.
- Manipulates data structures (includes dplyr, tidyr, purr, tibble, etc packages)

**Method 1**
```{r, eval= FALSE}

install.packages("tidyverse")

```

**Method 2** - Point and Click

+ Tools -> Install Packages

Only have to do this once!!

---
### Step 2: Load Package

Let's load the package we just installed!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Will have to run this every time we are in a new session and want to use this package

**Note**: Packages do update


---
### Functions

Think of a function like a verb:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
do_this(to_this)
```

**Functions** are sets of instructions that take **arguments** and **return** values


*R* has pre-made functions found in packages, but later in the semester we will talk about how to create your own functions

---
### Directories & File Paths

- A **directory** is just a fancy name for a folder.
- Your **working directory** is the folder that `R` "thinks" it lives in at the moment.
  - If you save things you have created, they save to your working directory by default.

- A **path** describes where a certain file or directory lives.

```{r}
getwd()
```

- Organize your folders carefully, and name them meaningfully:
  - `/Users/akl95311/DSC365/lab1/` rather than `Desktop/stuff/`
  
---
### Load Data

- **Course focus**: .csv file (download from Chrome)

- **Recommendation**: Save the data set to the same file folder as your R file

**Method 1**:

1). Session -> Set Working Directory -> Choose Directory -> Select folder data set is located -> Apply

2).  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
data <- read.csv("movie-2018.csv")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data <- read.csv("../data/movie-2018.csv")
```

---
### Load Data

**Method 2**: Import Data set in Environment Tab

- Works well for .csv/.xlsx files 
- Environment Tab -> Import Dataset -> From Text -> Find Dataset -> "Open" -> "Import"
- Runs the code for you in your console (would recommend pasting this into your R Script)

---
### Check Data

Need to make sure data is loaded in correctly
- Should see data in environment panel (upper right)

```{r, linewidth=100}
head(data, n = 3) #make sure data loads in correctly
```

---
### Variable Types

+ A **value** is a basic unit of stuff that a program works with.

+ Values have **types**:

  1. **logical / boolean**: FALSE/TRUE or 0/1 values.

  2. **integer**: whole numbers.

  3. **double / float / numeric**: decimal numbers.

  4. **character / string** - holds text, usually enclosed in quotes.


---
### Check Variable Types

```{r, linewidth=140}
glimpse(data)
```

<br>
<br>

**Note**: The purpose of checking variable types is to make sure R is understanding what each column is representing.

---
### Change Variable Types

*R* does not always read in the variables correctly. For example, `Average.audience` is being read in as a character, when it should be a number. We can change this!

```{r}
#To change this column to a number:
data$Average.audience <- as.numeric(data$Average.audience)


#Now Opening.Weekend is a number!
class(data$Average.audience)

```

<br>
<br>


[More about Data Types](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/r-data-types/)

---
### Selecting Specific Row/Column

We use **square brackets** [] to access elements within data structures.

  + In R, we start indexing from 1.
  

```{r}
data[1,] #first row
data[,1] #first column 
```

---
### Selecting Specific Row/Column

```{r}
data[1:4,c(2,5,7)] #row: 1-2, column: 2,5,7
```

We can use `$` to specify columns as well

```{r}
head(data$Film)
```


---
### Some Basic Functions

```{r}
summary(data[,7:10])

nrow(data)

ncol(data)
```

---
### Some Basic Functions
```{r , linewidth=100}
table(data$Primary.Genre)
```


---
### Built-In Statistical Functions

```{r}
mean(data$Domestic.Gross, na.rm = TRUE) #na.rm removes missing values
sd(data$Domestic.Gross, na.rm = TRUE)
summary(data$Domestic.Gross)
quantile(data$Domestic.Gross, c(0.025, 0.975), na.rm = TRUE) 
```

---
### Getting Help

Let's talk about a couple ways to get help. The primary function to use is the `help` function. Just pass in the name of the function you need help with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
help(head)
```

The `?` also works
```{r eval = FALSE}
?head
```

This returns the help documentation for this function

Googling for help can be difficult at first. You might need to search for R +  to get good results

---
### Warnings vs. Errors

+ Routinely beginners to R panic if they see a red message as innocuous as confirming that a library loaded
  - Not all red text means that there is an error!

+ A *warning* is a message that does not disturb the program flow but is displayed along with the output

  - Not always a cause for concern

+ An *error* will terminate a program from being ran


---
### Learning to code can be challenging

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt= "A cartoon depicting the different stages of learning how to code. You start off by thing you are fine, gradually get more frustrated until you want to have a meltdown, and then hopefully ends with solving your problem and loving to code."}

### Some Debugging Tips

Here is a few strategies if your code does not work:

- Google/AI!
    + Whenever you see an error message, start by googling it. If you’re lucky, you’ll discover that it’s a common error with a known solution. When googling, improve your chances of a good match by removing any variable names or values that are specific to your problem.

- Make sure the problem does exist.
    + Sometimes the error may not cause by the current lines you are working on. It is possible that you have changed something earlier. Try to re-run the files from the beginning.

- Run the functions part by part till you find the problem. 

- Print out the output to see whether it is the one you want. Sometimes look at the data type may also help you understand what's going on. 

---
### Some Debugging Tips

- Take a break! You won't effectively debug something if you're stressed.

- Check your spelling

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align='center', fig.alt="A cartoon in four phases of a person growing frustrated with their computer in phases one through three. Then in the final phase they realize their issue was they just spelled a variable wrong."}

knitr::include_graphics("~/Documents/Classes/MTH365/mth-365/01-Welcome/R Introduction Slides/images/spelling-error.png")

```

---
### A Couple Common Errors

1). Typos:

```{r, error = TRUE}
example_error <- 5
exampleerror
```

2). Unloaded Package
```{r, error = TRUE}
favstats(data$Domestic.Gross)
```

3). Wrong Data Type

```{r, error = TRUE}
"a" + 2
```
