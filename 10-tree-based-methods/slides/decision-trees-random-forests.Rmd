### Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

Learning techniques fall into two categories:

1). Supervised learning:

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

2). Unsupervised learning: 

---
### Tree-Based Methods

- Can be used for both regression and classification
  + Regression models $\longrightarrow$  quantitative response variable
<br>

  + Classification models $\longrightarrow$ categorical response 
<br>


- These involve stratifying or segmenting the predictor space into a number of simple regions


---
### Example: Marijuana legalization

The General Social Survey is a wide-ranging survey conducted biannually to measure cultural shifts in American society. We can use the GSS to get an idea of how popular opinion has changed.

.tiny[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
GSS <- read.csv("GSS2016.csv")
glimpse(GSS)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
GSS <- read.csv("./GSS2016.csv")
glimpse(GSS)
```
]

---
### Let's Clean Our Data! Yay!

- Let's only look at one year, say 2016, and remove "Not applicable from our response"

```{r}
GSS <- GSS %>% filter(YEAR==2016) %>% 
  filter(GRASS != 'Not applicable')
```

- Want just two groups for responses: Legal and Not legal

```{r}
GSS <- GSS %>%
mutate(LEGAL = ifelse(GRASS=='Legal', 'Legal', 'Not legal'))

```

- Change variables to proper type

```{r}
GSS$AGE <- as.numeric(GSS$AGE)
```

---
### Testing data v. Training data

**Goal**: Use Age to predict people’s opinion of marijuana legalization.

```{r}
set.seed(4)
test_id <- sample(1:nrow(GSS), size=round(0.2*nrow(GSS)))
TEST <- GSS[test_id,]
TRAIN <- GSS[-test_id,]
```

<br>

How many people in the training data set support marijuana legalization?

```{r}
TRAIN %>% group_by(LEGAL) %>% summarize(n=n())
```

### Decision Trees

Decision trees: A tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences

- Has flowchart-like structure in which each...

<br>

<br>
<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',out.width="75%"}

knitr::include_graphics("./images/decision-tree.png")

<br>
<br>

How to decide to split?

- As the number of predictors increases, so does the number of possible trees.
  + Optimal decision trees do not exist (Hyafil & Rivest, 1976)
  + So several competing methods for building decision trees

---
### Decision Trees (Classification)

Recursive Partitioning: Split an infinite # of times until some stopping criterion is reached.

Split:
  + Gini Index (default): 
    
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Stop:

- Complexity parameter

### Fitting A Decision Tree (Classification)

```{r}
#install.packages('rpart')
library(rpart)
rpart(LEGAL~AGE, data=TRAIN, na.action = na.pass)
```

---
### Visualizing a Decision Tree (Classification)

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=10, eval = FALSE}
#install.packages("rattle")
library(rattle)
tree <- rpart(LEGAL~AGE, data=TRAIN, na.action = na.pass)
fancyRpartPlot(tree)
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
tree <- rpart(LEGAL~AGE, data=TRAIN, na.action = na.pass)

```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',out.width="75%"}

knitr::include_graphics("./images/tree1.png")

```

---
### Visualizing using ggplot

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=8, fig.align='center'}
TRAIN %>% ggplot(aes(x=LEGAL, y=AGE)) +
geom_boxplot(aes(col=LEGAL)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept=69, col='black') 
```

---
### Evaluating a decision tree

- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Accuracy

---
### Confusion Matrix

```{r}
TRAIN <- TRAIN %>%
  mutate(Legal_Tree = predict(tree, type='class'))

confusion_train <- tally(Legal_Tree~LEGAL, data=TRAIN)
confusion_train
```

```{r}
TEST <- TEST %>%
  mutate(Legal_Tree = predict(tree, type='class', newdata = TEST))

confusion_test <- tally(Legal_Tree~LEGAL, data=TEST)
confusion_test
```

---
### Classification Accuracy

Training Accuracy:

```{r}
sum(diag(confusion_train))/nrow(TRAIN)
```

Testing Accuracy:

```{r}
sum(diag(confusion_test))/nrow(TEST)
```


---
### Tuning Parameter: Complexity parameter

Using recursive paritioning can overfit the training data - Prune Tree 

.tiny[
```{r, message=FALSE}
printcp(tree)
```
]

- Change CP (Example)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rpart(LEGAL~AGE, data=TRAIN, na.action = na.pass,
      control = rpart.control(cp = 0.05))

```

How to decide to split?

- Find regions $(R_j)$ that minimizes the residual sum of squares $$RSS = \sum^{J}_{j=1}\sum_{i \in R_j}(y_i - \hat{y}_{R_j})^2)$$. 

  - Stops when you reach some criterion (cp).


---
### Fitting A Decision Tree (Regression)

Let's suppose we want to use people’s political view (POLVIEWS) and marital status (MARITAL) to estimate people’s age.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tree2 <- rpart(AGE~POLVIEWS+MARITAL, data=TRAIN)
fancyRpartPlot(tree2)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tree2 <- rpart(AGE~POLVIEWS + MARITAL, data=TRAIN)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',out.width="75%"}

knitr::include_graphics("./images/tree2.png")

```

---
### Prediction for Decision Regression Tree

We can still use the predict function to predict our regression decision tree outputs. 
```{r}
TEST <- TEST %>% filter(MARITAL != "No answer") 

predict(tree2, TEST , method = "anova") %>% head()
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


**Be Careful**: Can only predict using categorical variables located in the Training Set

---
### Trees Versus Linear Models

- If the relationship between the features and the response is well approximated by
a linear model: 
  + Linear regression 
  
<br>
<br>

- If instead there is a highly nonlinear and complex relationship between the features and the response as indicated by model: 
  + Decision trees

### Random Forests

A random forest is collection of decision trees that are aggregated by majority rule

  
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

When to use random forest:



---
### Building a Random Forest

In building a random forest, each time a split in a tree is considered, a random sample of *m* predictors is chosen as split candidates from the full set of *p* predictors. 

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Hence, at each split in the tree, the algorithm is not even allowed to consider a majority of the available predictors. Why is this a good thing?

---
### Random Forests 

**Example**: Which variables are most important for predicting views on marijuana legalization?


.tiny[
```{r, message=FALSE}
#install.packages('randomForest')
library(randomForest)

forest_grass <- randomForest(as.factor(LEGAL)~NEWSFROM+HAPPY+
                               RELIG+COURTS+ENERGY+EDUC+ENVIR+
                               POLVIEWS+PARTYID+REGION+INCOME+
                               SEX+DEGREE+AGE+MARITAL+BALLOT, 
                             data=TRAIN, na.action = na.omit,
                             ntree=201, mtry=4)

forest_grass
```
]

---
### Random Forests: Prediction

```{r}
TEST <- TEST %>%
  mutate(Legal_RF = predict(forest_grass, type='class', 
                            newdata = TEST)) 

TEST$Legal_RF[1:5]

confusion_test <- tally(Legal_RF~LEGAL, data=TEST)
sum(diag(confusion_test))/nrow(TEST)
```

---
### Variable Importance

Since each tree in a random forest uses a different set of variables, we want to keep track of which variables seem to be the most consistently influential. 

.tiny[
```{r}
randomForest::importance(forest_grass) %>% as.data.frame() %>% 
  rownames_to_column() %>% arrange(desc(MeanDecreaseGini))
```
]


---
### Decision Tree with Selected Importance

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tree4 <- rpart(LEGAL~AGE+REGION+POLVIEWS, data=TRAIN)
fancyRpartPlot(tree4)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tree4 <- rpart(LEGAL~AGE+PARTYID, data=TRAIN)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("./images/tree4.png")

```

---
### Your Turn: Age

Which variables are most important for predicting `Age`? Use these to create a Decision Tree. Note: Check column name when you arrange the importance variables.


---
### If Time: Iris Data

Here is the data from credit card customers. One variable that credit card companies are often interested in is utilization: how much of the available credit limit is currently being “used”?

```{r}
data("iris")
```

1. Separate into training and testing set
2. Fit a random Forest Model (Species)- Decide variable importance
3. Using your most important variables, create a decision tree
4. Evaluate your decision Tree

---
### Summary 

Linear model: The basic model for regression, easy for interpretation, but has strict assumption thus hard to get a better prediction

Decision tree: Can be applied to regression and classification. Has good data visualization but it has high variance. 

Random Forest: a collection of tree models. Hard for interpretation but it can output variable importance. Can be useful if you have a lot of variable and what want to select the most useful ones. Also, if you have variables are not independent with each other, it performs better than the linear model. 

KNN：Can be applied to regression and classification. relatively fast, no assumption need and add data anytime. May affect the accuracy if we have too many variables and need to use CV to decide the k value.
