## What will be in this course?

- This is a programming course using *R*, the most commonly used statistical language
- We will also cover some statistical concepts (different than math!)
- In this course you will complete in-class labs, projects, and presentations.
- Since this course invovles using *R*, please bring your laptops to class with you

### How to Learn a Programming Language

If you have never used *R* (or even heard of it) before, it is totally OK! We will be starting with the basics.

.pull-left[
- Breathe
- Mistakes are ok!
- Ask for help, with a reproducible example
- Translate code into plain English
- Don't reinvent the wheel
- Google is your friend!

### What is R?

*R* is a free software environment and programming language for statistical computing and graphics

- Open-source
- According to it's website, "R is a system for statistical computation and graphics" [(Source)](https://www.r-project.org)
- **Interpreted language**: we interact with R through a “command line” interpreter, which translates our “code” to machine code
- CRAN is R's central software repository. Contains contributed packages


---

### What is R Studio?

Every R installation comes with the *R* Console, so we don’t actually need an additional program to interface with R. BUT most of people who uses *R* ALSO uses RStudio to interact with it.

- “Integrated Development Environment”
- Clean user interface
- Ability to see loaded data sets, packages, history
- Write code in separate “scripts” from the console

---

### Implication of Open-Source Software

Because *R* is open source, users can contribute *R* packages to add additional functions and capabilities (more than 16,000 as of November 2020). 

- A complete list can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html)
- Pro: New statistical/data science techniques are added to CRAN, Bioconductor (another package repository), GitHub, etc. daily
- Con: No standard syntax! Not all are well documented

---

### Reproducible Research

Excerpt from the Simply Statistics blog: “The Real Reason Reproducible Research is Important” [Source](https://simplystatistics.org/2014/06/06/the-real-reason-reproducible-research-is-important/MTH)

- **Reproducible**: the original data (and original computer code) can be analyzed (by an independent investigator) to obtain the same results of the original study.
- Reproducibility is important because it is the only thing that an investigator can guarantee about a study.

More reasons to do your programming in a reproducible way:

1. **Time saved**: especially important in the professional world
2. **Time elapsed**: even the best programmers forget how their code runs eventually

---

### Reproducible Research with R Markdown

R Markdown provides “an authoring framework for data science”. In an R Markdown document, you can:

- Save and execute code
- Generate written reports that can be shared with someone else
- Supported file formats: Word, PDF, HTML, slide shows, handouts, dashboards, Powerpoint

### Let's Install it Together

1. Download and run the R installer for your operating system from CRAN
  - Windows: https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/
  - Mac: https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/
  - Linux: https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/
2. Now download RStudio from the RStudio website – IDE of R
 - https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/
3. If you are using a Mac, you may need to download XQuartz.
https://www.xquartz.org/
 - If you run into issues, try downloading this to see if it helps.
