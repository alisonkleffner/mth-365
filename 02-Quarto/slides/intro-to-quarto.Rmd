### Replicability vs Reproducability

The notion that scientific findings can be confirmed repeatedly through replication is fundamental to science.

- Replicability means that you get the same results with different data
- **Reproducibility** means that you get the same results with the same data

<br>

The [replication crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis) is a very real problem for modern science. 
- More than 15 years ago, [Ioannidis (2005)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1182327/#glossary1) argued that “most published research findings are false.”
- It now appears that even among peer-reviewed, published scientific articles, many of the findings—which are supported by experimental and statistical evidence—do not hold up under the scrutiny of replication. 

---
### Reproducability

What you are probably using to write:
- Microsoft Word
- Latex/Overleaf
- Google Docs

However, how get R code into these documents?
  - Modern software tools allow the analysis to be repeated at the push of a button

---
### Literate Programing

A programming method where you explain code in natural language (ex. English) in roughly the same place that you write the code.
  - Use it to explain the purpose of our code and how to use it

<br>

Available Literate Programming options with R

- `knitr` is primarily focused on the creation of Rnw (r no weave) files, which are essentially LaTeX files with R code inside. Rnw files are compiled into pdfs.
- `rmarkdown` uses Rmd or Rmarkdown files, which can then be compiled into many different formats: pdf, html, markdown, Microsoft Word.
- `quarto` uses qmd files, which are compiled into many different formats: pdf, html, markdown, Microsoft Word.




---
### Knit what?

- Quarto adds (renders) `R` code into your document so that all of the files for a particular experiment are in one place.
- Compiling the document also runs the `R` code, so one button press runs your statistical analysis and places it in your document.
- Integrates `R` output with the document text so that pictures, tables, and numerical data are all dependent on the `R` code.
- Produces beautiful, seamless integration of statistical analysis with scientific writing

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height="65%", out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../02-Quarto/slides/images/render-process.png")
```


---
### Reproduceable Research

How does this help with reproduceable research?
- Journals often require code and data to be included in a paper submission so the analysis can be reproduced
- Statistical analyses are often re-used for multiple similar experiments (replication)
- We don't always comment code when we write it (though we should) - `quarto` provides context for the code by including the writeup with the code.

---
### What is Quarto?

- Allows you to "weave together narrative text and code to produce elegantly formatted output as documents, web pages, blog posts, books and more!" ([source](https://quarto.org/docs/faq/rmarkdown.html))
- R developed *R Markdown* to create documents that include R code, and *Quarto* is their attempt to bring *R Markdown* to everyone.
  - Developed to be multilingual, beginning with R, Python and Javascript.


Most of what we do today can be found in the [Quarto Website](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html) 

---
### Set-Up

+ Install the Necessary Packages
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("knitr", "rmarkdown"))
```
  - This alone will allow you to create `HTML` and Word documents (if you have Word installed)

+ If you want to create pdfs (and don't have a Latex installation): install TinyTex
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tinytex")
library(tinytex)
install_tinytex()
```

---
### Creating a Quarto Document

File -> New File -> Quarto Document 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height="65%", out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../02-Quarto/slides/images/quarto.jpg")
```

---
### Contents of a .qmd

1. An (optional) YAML header surrounded by `---s`
2. Code chunks beginning with ````{r}`
3. Text mixed with simple text formatting (the markdown)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height="65%", out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../02-Quarto/slides/images/quarto-document.png")
```

---
### Let's Render this document

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../02-Quarto/slides/images/quarto-run.png")
```



---
### YAML

The stuff at the top of the .amd file (called YAML front matter) tells **quarto** what output format you want. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height="40%", out.width="60%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../02-Quarto/slides/images/yaml.png")
```

<br>

In this case, when you click "Render", RStudio calls `quarto::quarto_render("document-name.qmd", , output_format = "html")`. You can certainly change these default values. 

---
### What is a Code Chunk?

In .qmd files, you can start/end a code chunk with three back-ticks. `quarto` knows that text is R code if it is included in a chunk.


```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../../02-Quarto/slides/images/code-chunk.png")
```


When you render your .qmd file, Quarto will run each code chunk and embed the results beneath the code chunk in your final report.


---
## Create Code Chunk:

.pull-left[
Option 1:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height="70%", out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../../02-Quarto/slides/images/create-code-chunk.png")
```
].pull-right[
Option 2:

- Mac: `option+command+i`
- Windows: `control+alt+i`
]

---
### Code Chunk Options

There are many options to give you greater control over what is shown in the compiled document (identified by `#|` at the beginning of the line).

- eval=FALSE: don't run the code

- echo=FALSE: don't show the code

- warning=FALSE: don't add R's warnings to the pdf

- message=FALSE: don't show messages from R in the pdf

- include=FALSE: don't include any R output in the document. 

- cache=FALSE: re-run all of the code every time.

Let's look at these options in [the documentation](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/)

### Markdown: Any Writing

```
This is a really smart sentence you wrote. 

### You can Bold your headers

You also emphasize *important* words. 

You can also **bold** important words.
